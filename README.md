# Ideas
Ideas for anyone to take and run with! 

Want to build something on Story but don't know what yet? This repo collates all ideas. If you have questions on any idea, just open an Issue referencing the number of the idea.

1. **Figma Plugin**: Develop a plugin for Figma, Photoshop, and other popular creator tools that facilitates the registration of intellectual property (IP). This plugin would streamline the process for creators, allowing them to easily register their designs, artwork, and other creations directly from within their preferred design tool, ensuring that their IP is protected and properly documented from the moment of creation.

2. **Telegram Bot**: Create a Telegram bot that can be added to channels for IP registration. This bot would enable channel owners to register any images shared within the channel easily. Registration could be triggered by a consensus emoji reaction from the group members or directly by the image's author. This tool would simplify the IP registration process in group settings, promoting better IP management and protection in social media environments.

3. **IP-friendly Meme Generator**: Develop a meme remixing tool that includes automatic IP registration. This tool would allow users to create and remix memes while ensuring that all created content is properly registered and protected. By integrating IP registration into the meme creation process, this tool would help creators safeguard their original ideas and maintain control over their digital content.

4. **Licensing Marketplace**: Build an optimized licensing marketplace for sourcing stock photos, stock videos, music for commercial use, audio sample packs, and field recordings. This platform would provide a comprehensive resource for creators looking to find high-quality, licensable content, making it easier for them to source the materials they need while ensuring that all content is properly licensed and credited.

5. **Chat-GPT Plugin**: Create a plugin for Chat-GPT that either facilitates asset registration or assists users in understanding fair usage within metadata. This chatbot could answer questions like "Can I do x with y?" and help users navigate the complexities of IP law and fair usage policies, making it easier for them to use and share digital content responsibly.

6. **IP Graph Browser Extension**: Develop a browser extension that visualizes IP relationships and ownership. This tool would help users explore and understand the connections between different IP assets, providing a clear and interactive way to navigate the web of IP ownership. It would be particularly useful for creators, researchers, and legal professionals who need to track and manage IP rights.

7. **Screenshot App**: Create an app for capturing still images and GIFs with rudimentary image editing capabilities and streamlined output. This app could potentially integrate with Magma for enhanced functionality. By offering simple editing tools and easy sharing options, this app would help users create and distribute high-quality screenshots while ensuring that their IP is protected.

8. **SynthID Detector and Registrar**: Develop a tool that can detect and register files watermarked by SynthID or similar methods. SynthID is a watermarking method for AI-generated content across various mediums. This tool would enable users to register AI-generated content on Story Protocol with the correct metadata, ensuring that all such content is properly documented and protected.

9. **IP Violation Finder**: Create a plugin that helps IP owners scrape the web to find instances where their IP is being monetized without permission. This tool would assist creators and IP owners in identifying and addressing unauthorized use of their work, helping them to protect their rights and potentially take legal action against violators.

10. **Onchain Chronicles Remix Station**: Develop an AI-assisted visual art installation/experience where attendees can interact with an AI prompt station to remix digital assets. This station would allow users to create unique visual art pieces by remixing existing digital assets, promoting creativity and engagement while ensuring that all remixed content is properly registered and credited.

11. **WE IP**: Create a platform for collective ownership and licensing of IP assets. This platform would allow people to pool funds to acquire on-chain or off-chain assets for the purpose of owning and licensing the IP of those assets. For example, a DAO could be formed to purchase or bid on an auction for "lofi beats to study to," enabling collective ownership and monetization of the IP.

12. **ManifestDao**: Develop a governance platform and validator network called ManifestDao, which ensures that works guided by manifestos remain true to their source. This platform would provide a structured approach to governance, allowing creators and communities to ensure that their projects adhere to the principles and guidelines set forth in their manifestos, thereby maintaining the integrity and authenticity of their work.
